# INTRODUCING A FUNCTION

A function is a mathematical concept that represent a relationship between a source set, called domain, and a target set called codomain. This relationship has the characteristic that all elements in the domain must have one and only one corresponding element in the codomain.


A function is represented in the form

f(x) = 2 * x

We can write this function as
twice(x) = 2 * x

This means the twice function is equivalent to 2 * x.

Wherever you encounter twice(x), you can replace it with 2 * x.

We have the basics now. There is a reason why we called it a relationship. There is a reason why that relationship is establishied between a domain and codomain.

The domain in the above example are positive integers. We use the concept of a function to represent a relationship that is equivalent to each member of domain, positive integers, such as 1,2,3,4 etc to 2,4,6 etc.
