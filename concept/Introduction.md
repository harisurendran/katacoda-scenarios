A book or practice guide with a browser based environment to practice the code that is being presented in the course material. The problems solved are given below.

* Some environments such as Kubernetes is difficult to set up and maintain.
* An environment to run Java code is not, but still some contect switching and issues are to be expected for a beginner.
* A Kubernetes environment can pack lot of application densely and provide isolation.
* An environment that can be thrown away and recreated removes head aches.
* At the same time, the code can be saved in a gitgub environment.

Therefore the overall strategy is

* Use AWS for computing resources
* Use K8S for dense packing
* Use github for source code storage and maintenance
* Use browser based UI for user experience
* Use mobile app for duolingo type learning
* Use mobile app for duolingo type learning
