# Dependency

Dependencies need to be managed. 
There are different types of dependencies such as first party dependencies within the same code. Then there are dependencies within its runtime and third party dependencies which are libraries that we use.

There are dependencies in the method level all the way to system level.

What is a dependency?

A dependency in software exist when one entity needs another to function or complete its scope of work. An entity can be a method or a function or a system. A depends on B imply that A cannot complete its work without B. However B is not dependent on A. It can complete its work without A. 
Entity B may have its own dependencies. Thus there is a dependency chain.
