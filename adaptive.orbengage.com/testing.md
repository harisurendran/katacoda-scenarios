## Unit testing

It is one of the application testing methods. How accurately a part of a code that fullfills the requirements.
Unit testing is writng code that tests other code.

The process of writing unit tests, then writing code and and then testing and improving creates a positive feedback loop.


As a safety net it should be considered mandatory for any software development.

Production code should be entirely the result of the tests that were written to verify the appications behaviour.


# How unit tests can prevent anti-patterns and technical debt ?


# Given, when, and Assert pattern

This is also referred as arrangement, act and assert pattern. Arrange the preconditions for the code to execute, then perform the act and then assert that the expected behaviour has occured.
