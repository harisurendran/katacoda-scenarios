# Coupling and Cohesion

We have talked about the need for reduction of complexity in code. Cohesion and couplng are key to good software desgin at every level. From functions and classes all the way to sytems and products.

## Cohesion

Cohesion is the property of code where all components belong together. A method should be cohesive, so should be a class, or a libray or component. 

## Coupling

Coupling is a reflection of the strength of the relationship between software elements.
